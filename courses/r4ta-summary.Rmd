This course teaches two skill-sets that are fundamental in modern transport research: programming and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). By combining these two, to develop flexible, extensible models, and analyse and visualise the results at the local level, a wide range of research questions and practical problems can be tackled. The skill-sets learned during the course are generalisable and help provide answers to many transport research question, including:

- How to handle large transport datasets?
- Where to locate new transport infrastructure? 
- How can increasingly available datasets on air quality, traffic and active travel be analysed and visualised to inform transport policy?
- How to develop automated and reproducible transport planning workflows?

This course will provide tools, example code and data and above all face-to-face teaching to empower participants with new software to answer these questions and more. The focus is on the programming language R (we will briefly look at visualising results in QGIS). However, the principles and skills learned will be cross-transferable to other languages. By providing strong foundations in spatial data handling and the use of an up-coming language for statistical computing, R for Transport Applications aims to open a world of possibilities for generating insight from your transport datasets for researchers in the public sector, academia and industry alike.
