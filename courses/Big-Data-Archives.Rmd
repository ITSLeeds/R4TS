## Data Life Cycle

- Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the amount of data being made **publicly available**
- **Data curation** allows for the **re-use** of previously generated data for new purposes
- This provides researchers with access to a wealth of **secondary data sources**

```{r, out.height="300", out.width="400", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/DCCDataLifecycle.png")
```

## Data Stores

- Data can be stored in a number of different repositories, ranging from **personal collections to international archives**
- As data moves up the storage hierarchy, it generally **increases in reach**
- The presence of **national data centres** has expanded significantly

```{r, out.height="300", out.width="500", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/DataHierarchy.jpg")
```

## National Data Centres

- A number of centres of UK data have now been established
