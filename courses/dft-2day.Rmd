See https://github.com/ITSLeeds/R4TS/blob/master/courses/dft-2day.Rmd

Assumed prior knowledge:

- Working knowledge of R, e.g. have completed: 
  - Introduction to R free DataCamp course: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
  - Recommended reading: Section 4.2 of *Efficient R Programming* [@gillespie_efficient_2016]: https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/efficient-workflow.html#package-selection

- Some knowledge of tidyverse is highly recommended, e.g. already know the contents of or have read-up on **and tried examples from** the following 'cheatsheets':
  - Tidyverse for Beginners DataCamp Cheat Sheet (see [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Tidyverse+Cheat+Sheet.pdf)). **At a minimum you will have completed up to Chapter 5 on this online course** (this may take ~2 hours)
  - Data wrangling with dplyr and tidyr RStudio cheet cheet (see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf))
  
<!-- **It's in the Analysis directorate** -->

## Computing Requirements

- DfT will provide desktops with recent versions of R and RStudio installed, including:
  - R 3.5.3 recommended (although any R 3.5 release should work): https://cran.r-project.org/
  - RStudio 1.1.436 - see https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
  - Will require up-to-date versions of **tidyverse** and **sf** packages, at a minimum
  - Other packages we'll use:
    - stats19
    - stplanr
    - tmap
    - devtools
    - The GitHub package spDataLarge, which can be installed as follows:
    
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Nowosad/spDataLarge")
```

- Own laptops allowed, provided necessary data is installed

- Data: all data will be either provided by packages or downloaded on the day (assuming good internet)
  - A test to check if data downloads work is accessing stats19 data (check this works):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
crashes = stats19::get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "accidents", ask = FALSE)
```

- A script to test set-up will be provided to test it all works

## Optional extra reading

- Optional extra reading: for context, you may want to read-up on:
  - Overview of GIS in R, e.g. in Chapter 1 of *Geocomputation with R* or this blog post: https://www.jessesadler.com/post/gis-with-r-intro/
  - stplanr: A package for transport planning[@lovelace_stplanr:_2018]
  - R for data science [@grolemund_r_2016]
  - For an overview of spatial transport data types, see  Chapter 12 of *Geocomputation with R* [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019]: http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html
