# R for Transport Applications: Handling Big Data in Spatial World

Next on: 26^th^ and 27^th^ April.

Prices: to be confirmed.

## Overview

This course teaches two skill-sets that are fundamental in modern transport research: programming and data analytics, with a focus on spatial data. Combining these enables powerful transport planning and analysis workflows for tackling a wide range of problems, including:

- How to effectively handle large transport datasets?
- Where to locate new transport infrastructure? 
- How to develop automated and reproducible transport planning workflows?
- How can increasingly available datasets on air quality, traffic and active travel be used to inform policy?
- How to visualise results in an attractive and potentially on-line and interactive manner?

This course will provide tools, example code and data and above all face-to-face teaching to empower participants with new software to answer these questions and more.
The focus is on the programming language R (we will briefly look at visualising results in QGIS). However, the principles and skills learned will be cross-transferable to other languages. By providing strong foundations in spatial data handling and the use of an up-coming language for statistical computing, R for Transport Applications aims to open a world of possibilities for generating insight from your transport datasets for researchers in the public sector, academia and industry alike.

As with any language, it is important to gain a strong understanding
of the underlying syntax and structure before moving on to complex uses. 
This course therefore starts with the foundations: how R can be used to load,
manipulate, process, transform and visualise spatial data.

In terms of content, the **first day** will focus on how the R language works, general concepts in efficient R programming, and spatial and non-spatial data classes in R. Building on this strong foundation the **second day** will cover the application of the skills developed in Day 1 to transport datasets, with a focus on geographical transport data.

## Learning objectives

### Day 1:

- Learn and consolidate the basics of R's syntax
- Discover time-saving tips for efficient programming
- Discover how add-on R packages such as **dplyr** can be used to improve productivity
- Understand how R can be used to read, process and save transport-related datasets
- Understand the structure of spatial data in R

### Day 2:

- Be able to query, subset and analyse spatial objects
- Have a working knowledge of fundamental GIS functions such as changing projections
- Be proficient in the use of R to create maps using add-on packages such as **tmap**
- Have some experience with transport planning functions provided by **stplanr**
    - Route allocation
    - OD pair processing to generate geographic desire lines
    - Using the `overline()` function to aggregate routes to create a route network

### Prerequisites

Prior experience with transport datasets or common geographic data formats is **essential.**

Some exposure to software with a command-line interface, such as Stata, Python or R is **highly recommended**.

Attendees who are already proficient with their R programming skills are welcome to attend just the second day, although attendance of both days is recommended for most attendees: even advanced R users are likely to learn something on the first day.

**Computers** with RStudio installed will be available for course attendees. However, for maximum benefit, we recommend participants bring their own laptops, with the latest version of R installed.
Steps to set-up a suitable R/RStudio environment are described in sections [2.3](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#r-version) and [2.5](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio) of the book [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html).
It is also recommended the following packages are installed prior to attending the course:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c(
  "sf",
  "stplanr",
  "tidyverse",
  "tmap",
  "openair"
))
```
