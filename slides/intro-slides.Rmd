# Why R for transport applications?

## Features | Source: https://www.r-bloggers.com/on-the-growth-of-cran-packages/

R is an extremely flexible and (with the help of add-on packages) powerful language.

## Scalability

As datasets have grown, so has the importance of efficient computing.

- R was designed for efficiency - lots of 'leg-work' done in C
- R is conducive to cloud and parallel computing
- Easy to parallelise

## Visualisation | source: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/GIS4TA

- Vital for communication
- Increasingly interactive

# The R language

## R as a giant calculator

```{r, eval=FALSE}
5 * 5
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1 + 4 * 5
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
4 * 5 ^ 2
```

## Functions and objects

**In R:**

- Everything that exists is an object
- Everything that happens is a function

E.g., load a data object and find its dimension:

```{r}
data(mpg, package = "ggplot2") # load the object mpg
dim(mpg) # use a function (dim) to do something with it
```

## Objects

- R is *object-orientated*
- Objects persist in memory for the duration of the *session*
- Objects are usually assigned by the `<-` or `=` operator (usually identical)
- Any names can be give to R objects, except special characters like `\`
- Exercise: what do these commands do?

<div class="columns-2">

```{r}
a = 1
b = 2
c = "c"
x_thingy = 4
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a + b
a * b
a + c
a / x_thingy
```

</div>

## Adding and removing objects

```{r}
ls()
x <- x_thingy
rm(x_thingy)
x
ls()
```

## Functions

"R, at its heart, is a functional programming (FP) language. This means that it provides many tools for the creation and manipulation of functions."

- All functions have brackets (to run)
- The *arguments* of the functions go in the brackets

```{r}
replicate(n = 3, expr = x)
exp(x)
```


## Basic plotting

```{r}
x = 1:9
y = x^2
plot(x = x, y =y) 
```


## Demonstration then exercise: Getting used to RStudio and R

> - Open RStudio and have a look around
> - Create a new project
> - Create a new R Script: pass code to the console with `Ctl-Enter`
> - Use R as a calculator: what is:
> - Explore each of the 'panes'
> - Find and write down some useful shortcuts (`Alt-Shift-K` on Windows/Linux)

# R/RStudio tricks

## Printing the result during assignment

```{r}
# Assignment of x
x <- 5
x
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# A trick to print x
(x <- 5)
```

## The console or the script pane?

- Is it part of a longer story that will ultimately be shared? (use script files)
- Is it just playing that does not need to be stored? (use the console)

You can switch effortlessly between them with `Ctl+1` and `Ctl+2`.

## Assignment

- Be warned: easy to overwrite data

```{r}
x = 5 # the same as x <- 5
(x = x + 1)
```

## R is vector based

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 5)
x
x^2
x + 2
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x + rev(x)
```

## The classic programming way: verbose

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 5)
for(i in x){
  print(i^2)
}
```

Creating a new vector based on `x`

```{r}
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  if(i == 1) x2 <- x[i]^2
  else x2 <- c(x2, x[i]^2)
}
x2
```

## Data types

R has a hierarchy of data classes, tending to the lowest:

- Binary
- Integer (numeric)
- Double (numeric)
- Character

## Examples of data types

```{r}
a <- TRUE
b <- 1:5
c <- pi
d <- "Hello Leeds"
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
class(a)
class(b)
class(c)
class(d)
```

## Data type switching

```{r}
ab <- c(a, b)
ab
class(ab)
```


## Test on data types

```{r}
class(c(a, b))
class(c(a, c))
class(c(b, d))
```

## Sequences

```{r}
x <- 1:5
y <- 2:6
plot(x, y)
```

## Sequences with seq

```{r}
x <- seq(1,2, by = 0.2)
length(x)
x <- seq(1, 2, length.out = 5)
length(x)
```
