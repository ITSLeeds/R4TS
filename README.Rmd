# R for spatial transport data science

The repo provides a home for teaching material on handling spatial transport data in R.

To ask questions about the content, sign-up to GitHub and open an issue on the issue tracker at https://github.com/ITSLeeds/R4TS/issues

The course will use content from a range of sources, including: 

  - stplanr: A package for transport planning[@lovelace_stplanr:_2018]
  - R for data science [@grolemund_r_2016]
  - For an overview of spatial transport data types, see  Chapter 12 of *Geocomputation with R* [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019]: http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html
